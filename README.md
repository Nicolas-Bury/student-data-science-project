# student-data-science-project

This repository contains two data science projects completed during my professional data science program at Open Universiteit. Each project applies different techniques in data analysis, machine learning, and text analytics, all implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. These projects were sponsored by my previous employer, and I'm publishing the files I managed to recover. Unfortunately, some files, such as the task descriptions and source data, were lost when I left the company. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase what I learned during the program and demonstrate my knowledge at the time.

### Goal of the Program
The primary goal of this program was not to turn individuals into data scientists, but rather to equip managers, program managers, and data analysts with the tools and knowledge necessary to excel in working with data. It aims to raise awareness of what is possible with data science, helping them better understand and engage in informed discussions with data professionals. This will empower them to make more data-driven decisions and collaborate effectively with data science teams.

### Why These Projects Are Important
These projects demonstrate my ability (at that time) to work with real-world data, apply machine learning algorithms, and perform text analytics. They reflect my commitment to learning new skills and showcase my progress during the data science program.

## Projects
### 1. Binary Classification of Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease
**Overview:** This project focuses on classifying patients as either having chronic kidney disease (CKD) or not.  
The uploaded version includes comments and feedback from the reviewing professor (Tom Q). The task description is highlighted in red text within the notebook.  
The task was graded 9.5/10.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
**Overview:** This project involves performing sentiment analysis of tweets to classify them into distinct categories (e.g., anger, boredom, happiness, relief, sadness, etc.).  
The uploaded version includes comments from the professor (at the end) and sections with the task description highlighted in red.  
The task was graded 8.125/10.
